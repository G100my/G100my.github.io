## Space Radio (Jukebox)

As development was nearing completion, Spotify introduced a similar feature that allowed collaborative playlist editing, so I discontinued further development/maintenance.

Space Radio was a platform for requesting background music based on the Spotify API and Realtime database. It allowed multiple users to request songs, with one user's device handling music playback. Features included:

1. Song requests, insertions, deletions, and voting for skipping songs.
1. Volume fading during song transitions to prevent discomfort.
1. Fun and playful voice broadcast messages that could be targeted to specific individuals using robot-like voice assistants.
1. Quick access to a user's favorite songs.
1. Volume control.
1. User activity logging.
