## Hi, I'm Luo

a Taiwanese currently residing in Kaohsiung. You can often find me in coffee shops, tucked away in unassuming corners.

I work remotely and have actively engaged with programming languages in my past work experiences, which has paved the way for my current lifestyle as a free-spirited remote worker. I appreciate a touch of minimalism, although I don't excessively adhere to it.

I excel at simplifying complexity, crafting code that is well-structured, easy to understand, and neatly organized. I have a passion for creating clean, user-friendly web interfaces to achieve desired goals.

I am currently employed at Lubn, a startup company that provides remote property management solutions for homes.

Here are some of the technology areas I've delved into:
Vue/Nuxt, React, PWA, Google Chrome extension, Meta Spark AR, AWS, Github actions.
