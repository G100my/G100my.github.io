title: Hi, I'm Luo
---

A Taiwanese, currently living in Kaohsiung, and you can often find me in the unassuming corners of coffee shops.

A remote-working Web front-end devaloper. In my past work experiences outside of the information technology field. I took the initiative to delve into programming languages, leading me to the current lifestyle of remote freedom.

In life, I lean towards minimalism (less is more). It's great because it helps me clearly identify what I have and what matters, though it often leads to difficulty making decisions due to too many unnecessary choices.

In terms of work, I excel at simplifying complexity, crafting clear and understandable code, and enjoy creating clean, user-friendly web interfaces to achieve our goals. While my personality has some influence, I don't chase after peculiar writing styles. I do what's necessary, and I don't overcomplicate things.

Currently, I work at Lubn, a startup that provides remote property management solutions.
