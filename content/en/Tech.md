title: Skill & experience
---

My current job skills primarily focus on the frontend web development.
I often use a combination of Vue, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS to implement projects for both personal and work-related purposes.

In my daily development, I use Vitest for unit testing, and I am actively gaining experience in e2e testing and visual testing.

For a significant period in the past, I worked as an independent frontend developer, where I had to handle various tasks independently.
This included automating deployments, setting up AWS resources (S3, Cloudfront), packaging a web app into IOS and Android apps, and publishing them, Setting up a Monorepo Architecture and Publishing an inner shared components library npm Package.

Outside of work, I created two Instagram filters using Meta Spark AR for a friend's brand and published them.
I also had experience working as a backend developer, which gave me some knowledge of backend database structures.
